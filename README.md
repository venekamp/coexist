This project has yet to start. It will be an attempt to create a web
app that manages groups of people and those people authorize themselves
with an identity they already own, e.g. at their organization or
a social identity.

An administrator or other authorized person will be able to manage a
group of people that are entitled, based on their membership, to have
access services.

The underlying data model has not be designed yet, but this README
serves as a marking point of the start of this endeavour.
